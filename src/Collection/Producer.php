/**
 * An mergeable and shareable wrapper of `AsyncIterator`.
 * 
 * Feel free to skip the terminology on the first skim. Refer as needed.
 * 
 * **Terminology**:
 * - Keywords identified in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) are used with identical meaning in docblocks.
 * - _Arc_: The commands executed and time elapsed between two `await` statements without any `await` statements in between. Any arc is the _of_ the `Awaitable` at the _start_.
 * - _Resolved `Awaitable`_: Testing the `Awaitable` with `\HH\Asio\has_finished()` returns `true`.
 * - _Ready queue_: All resolved `Awaitable`s whose arcs have not yet begun. Their arcs have a real chance of beginning when control next returns to the top-level `HH\Asio\join`.
 * - _Endpoint_: Exactly one of the following that applies:
 *   1. The beginning of a {@see HHReactor\Collection\Producer::halt()} call to this Producer.
 *   2. The propagation of an `Exception` from any {@see HHReactor\Collection\Producer::next()} call
 *   3. The propagation of a `null` from any {@see HHReactor\Collection\Producer::next()} call
 *   - _Endpoint equality_: If two endpoints are resolved at the same time, but have not yet ended any of their respective consumers, they are equal. Put a different way, endpoints are equal up to the same ready queue.
 * - _Lifetime_: The union of all arcs from the creation of the Producer to the endpoint.
