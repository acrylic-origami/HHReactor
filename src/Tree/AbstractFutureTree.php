// WE ARE ONLY USING THIS CLASS WHILE WE WAIT FOR ANONYMOUS CLASSES. 

// Here's the lowdown: Closure::bind isn't a recognized interface method 
// (understandable so... though depending on the typing of the Closure object, 
// you might be able to glean something? idk) which means that this isn't
// type-safe, i.e. where I expect the lambda to return int, it could [provably]
// always return string, and I would be none the wiser.

// Anonymous classes would rectify this with constraints on the return parameter
// of _resolve.
